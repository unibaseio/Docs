# Intro

#### Unibase is the first AI-native data availability (DA) and storage layer that inherits Ethereum's security. It offers high performance and unlimited scalability, enabling anyone to build on-chain AI applications securely and cost-effectively.

Additionally, Unibase supports millions of Depin devices contributing hard drives, computing power, and bandwidth for mining.

#### Why Choose Unibase?

Current data availability solutions like EigenDA, Celestia, and Avail are primarily designed for ledger transactions and have the following limitations:

* **Performance and Capacity**: They cannot support the high data demands of AI and Depin (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) applications.
* **Security and Authenticity**: Off-chain data verification based on DAC (Data Availability Committee) or DAS (Data Availability Sampling) lacks the security and authenticity provided by Ethereum.

#### Use Cases

* **On-Chain Application Development**: Supports applications in various sectors, including Agent, Depin, Gaming, and Social.

Unibase stands out by providing a robust, scalable, and secure solution for the growing demands of on-chain AI and Depin applications, leveraging the strengths of Ethereum's security and the vast potential of decentralized infrastructure.
