# Intro

#### Unibase is the first AI-native data availability (DA) and storage layer that inherits Ethereum's security. It offers high performance and unlimited scalability, enabling anyone to build on-chain AI applications securely and cost-effectively.

Additionally, Unibase supports millions of Depin devices contributing hard drives, computing power, and bandwidth for mining.

#### Why Choose Unibase?

Current data availability solutions like EigenDA, Celestia, and Avail are primarily designed for ledger transactions and have the following limitations:

* **Performance and Capacity**: They cannot support the high data demands of AI and Depin (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) applications.
* **Security and Authenticity**: Off-chain data verification based on DAC (Data Availability Committee) or DAS (Data Availability Sampling) lacks the security and authenticity provided by Ethereum.

#### Use Cases

* **High-Performance Data Availability Layer**: A modular solution for AI and Depin public chains.
* **On-Chain Application Development**: Supports applications in various sectors, including Agent, Depin, Gaming, and Social.

#### Ecosystem Collaboration

* **AI Sector**: Collaborating with over twenty AI-related applications or Agent chain projects.
* **Depin Sector**: Serving as the high-performance DA solution in IoTeX's modular 2.0 architecture, benefiting hundreds of Depin projects in their ecosystem.
* **Miners**: Engaged with several large mining pools to participate in the testnet and mainnet launch.



Unibase stands out by providing a robust, scalable, and secure solution for the growing demands of on-chain AI and Depin applications, leveraging the strengths of Ethereum's security and the vast potential of decentralized infrastructure.
