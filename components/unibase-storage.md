# Unibase Storage

The AI Native Storage Layer is designed specifically to cater to the unique storage needs associated with managing AI-related data and models. Given the vast amounts of data that AI models require for training and inference, and the complex nature of these models, conventional decentralized storage solutions are often inadequate. Therefore, this layer provides specialized storage solutions that are equipped to handle these challenges.&#x20;

First, this layer is designed to meet the high-performance demands of AI services. Generative AI models require quick and efficient access to large amounts of data. Any delay or inefficiency in data access can significantly hamper the performance of the services. The AI Native Storage Layer, therefore, optimizes data storage and retrieval processes to ensure quick and seamless access to data, thereby enabling high-speed computations that AI services necessitate.&#x20;

Second, scalability is of paramount importance in decentralized AI as it directly impacts the system's capacity to manage and process vast quantities of data of large generative AI models. High scalability, signifies the system's immense storage capacity, designed to handle enormous data volumes up to EB level. Additionally, the inclusion of a private storage pool ensures that the system can cater to specific needs or clients, providing dedicated storage resources without compromising privacy or security.&#x20;

Third, the programmability of the storage solution brings a significant level of customization and automation to the decentralized AI system. Through the use of smart contracts, which are self-executing and have the terms of the agreement encoded into them, users can tailor ownership and access control to their specific needs. This not only offers flexibility but also enhances security, providing a robust mechanism to manage data in the decentralized network.

&#x20;Fourth, the system's native support for data assetization showcases its capacity to treat data as a valuable asset. This feature paves the way for operations like tokenization, trading, and monetization of data, opening up new avenues for users to derive value from their data. Thus, the programmability of the storage solution fundamentally enriches the decentralized AI system, allowing for a higher degree of customization, enhanced security, and novel ways to unlock the potential of data.&#x20;

In essence, the AI Native Storage Layer provides a robust and efficient storage solution for the UniBase ecosystem, enabling the system to effectively handle the unique and demanding storage needs of AI services.
